We have a [recurring meeting](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-multicast/2021Jul/0004.html) scheduled for the first Wednesday of the month at 10:30am Eastern time (2:30pm UTC during [US daylight savings](https://www.timeanddate.com/time/change/usa), or 3:30pm UTC during standard time).  If you would like to attend except that this time is unfriendly for your time zone, please [open an issue](https://github.com/w3c/multicast-cg/issues) and we will look for a good way to accommodate the request.
