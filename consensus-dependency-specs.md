# Overview

This is a list of IETF specifications that are considered likely-necessary underpinnings for success on the deliverables of the Multicast Web Community Group, and members of the group are therefore encouraged to review and track their progress.  This list should be updated as needed according to group consensus while the Multicast work incubates.

# Specifications

 - [DORMS](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-mboned-dorms)
 - [AMBBI](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-mboned-ambi)
 - Possibly [CBACC](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-mboned-cbacc)
 - Possibly [MNAT](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-mboned-mnat)
 - At least one multicast-specific web security considerations document ([a likely starting point](https://github.com/squarooticus/draft-krose-multicast-security) is begun, loosely modeled on the [WebRTC Security Considerations (RFC 8826)](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8826.html))
